#### Download all Azure Documentation for offline viewing

There have been several times when I've wished to have all the Azure documentation on my local computer whether it be a flight, etc.. I've never found a way except finding the [pieces of the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/) that I wanted and pressing the **Download PDF** button.

Until Now... 

If you want to download **ALL** of the Azure documentation, then follow the instructions below: 

1.) You'll need to first download [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) with is a JSON processor. If you have a Mac, then you can use `brew install jq`  or on Windows use Chocolatey NuGet `chocolatey install jq`. Sample output from my machine is below:

```text
Michaels-MBP:Documents mbcrump$ brew install jq
==> Installing jq
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/jq-1.5_3.high_sierra.bottle
################################################################################################################################################ 100.0%
==> Pouring jq-1.5_3.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz /usr/local/Cellar/jq/1.5_3: 19 files, 946.6KB
```

2.) Next you'll need to run the following command which uses curl and jq to download every PDF contained in the [GitHub repo](https://api.github.com/repositories/72685026/contents/articles?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-micrum): 

```text
for row in $(curl https://api.github.com/repositories/72685026/contents/articles | jq -c -r '.[] | select(.type | contains("dir")) | "\(.name)"'); do wget -O "${row}.pdf" "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/opbuildpdf/${row}/toc.pdf?branch=live"; done
```

3.) Give it some time as it is about 2GB and check the folder where you ran that command.

4.) Success! You'll see all the PDF file and you now have a current snapshot of Azure's documentation.
